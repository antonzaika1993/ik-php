Interkassa API for PHP
======================

This library simplifies working with [interkassa payment system V 2.0](http://new.interkassa.com).

Basic usage
-----------

First you have to include and initialize the library:

```php
<?php

include_once 'path/to/interkassa.php';
Interkassa::register();
```

This will register the library's autoload with PHP and allow you to use its
classes without any further include statements.

Next, let's create a simple payment:

```php
<?php

// The following parameters are provided by interkassa
$shop_id    = '...';
$secret_key = '...';

// Create a shop
$shop = Interkassa_Shop::factory(array(
    'id'         => $shop_id,
    'secret_key' => $secret_key
));

// Create a payment
$payment_id     = '...'; // Your payment id
$payment_amount = '...'; // The amount to charge your shop's user
$payment_desc   = '...'; // Payment description

$payment = $shop->createPayment(array(
    'id'          => $payment_id,
    'amount'      => $payment_amount,
    'description' => $payment_desc
));
```

We now have everything we need to render the payment form:

```php
<?php

// ... create and configure the payment object

?>
<form action="<?= htmlentities($payment->getFormAction()); ?>" method="post">
    <?php foreach ($payment->getFormValues() as $field => $value): ?>
    <input type="hidden" name="<?= htmlentities($field); ?>" value="<?= htmlentities($value); ?>" />
    <?php endforeach; ?>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

Processing payment status requests
----------------------------------

Interkassa can send payment status updates to a URL of your choosing. You can
configure this URL via your account on interkassa or send the URL with other
payment data:

```php
<?php

$payment = $shop->createPayment(array(
    // ... usual payment data
    'status_url' => 'http://example.com/ik-status.php'
));
```

And inside the `ik-status.php`:

```php
<?php

// ... initialize library as usual

$shop = Interkassa_Shop::factory(array(
    'id'         => $shop_id,
    'secret_key' => $secret_key
));

try {
    $status = $shop->receiveStatus($_POST); // POST is used by default
} catch (Interkassa_Exception $e) {
    // The signature was incorrect, send a 400 error to interkassa
    // They should resend payment status request until they receive a 200 status
    header('HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request');
    exit;
}

$payment = $status->getPayment();
```

This transparently checks the signature of the payment.

The `$status` variable now contains an instance of `Interkassa_Status` class. The
`$payment` variable holds an instance of `Interkassa_Payment` with all the initial
data.

Note, that success and fail status updates are also supported, but do not have
a signature, and are sent via the user's browser, so it is not recommended to
rely on them.

Requirements
------------

This library requires at least PHP 5.1.0 to work correctly. However, the most
recent PHP version is always recommended.
